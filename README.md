# Leaflet Challenge

--- 

This project consisted of creating a map using Leaflet that plots earthquake data based on each earthquake's latitude and longitude. 

---

## Obtain Data Set

The data set was obtained from USGS, and was provided in JSON representation. 

Link: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

## Import and Visualization

Using the JSON representation of earthquake data, a map was generated reflecting the magnitude of each earthquake by the size and depth by color. Earthquake with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greather depth appear darker in color. 

A second data set was used to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. 

The final visualization step included both a legend to discern earthquake depth and popups that provide additional information anout an earthquake when a marker is clicked.

The final step in this project, included deploying the app to GitHub pages to ultimately host the Earthquake Map website.
